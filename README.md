# Maieutic

The Maieutic robot is a fully open-source and 3d printable physical-expermiental platform intended for the study of manipulators kinematic control, artificial vision and reinforcement learning. It is an effort to build a affordable platform for the students in the "manipulators modeling and control" class to build their own low-cost model that allows them to continue experiment and learning outside campus.

# Main characteristics
- The morphology of the Maiuetic is a 6-DoF elbow manipulator with sperical wrist. 
- The robot is intended to be used with the Robot Operating System [(ROS2)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)
- The main controller board is an ESP32
- The cad files of the system are completely open-source using the [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) format
- An URDF descriptor is also available


# Demo
- **This project is still at an early stage and efforts are being made on the mechanical design.**
- **Some major changes have been made between the original mechanical structure and the current model.**
